# Game of Life

Your task is to create a [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
Please read the Wikipedia article carefully to understand the game rules. You can also watch the video
with an explanation of Conway's Game of Life from John Conway himself:

Use whichever libraries or you need. Give it your own personal style. However, please mind that the quality of our code
will be assessed. Consider using object oriented programming for all the elements of your program.

You need to fulfill the below [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story):

* When I first arrive at the game, it will randomly generate a board and start playing.

* I can start and stop the board.

* I can set up the board.

* I can clear the board.

* When I press start, the game will play out.

* Each time the board changes, I can see how many generations have gone by.

Once you finish the task you can consider adding your own variations to it by changing the game rules.
For example you can consider multi-colored game of life with more than one cell state and some transition rules
between them.
